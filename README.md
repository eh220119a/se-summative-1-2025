<h1>Centralised Tracking for Stand-Ups</h1>
A basic application for those working with daily meetings to track and manage who is due to host a meeting. This application will allow the clients to pass their colleagues names, assign dates to which the stand-ups shall be ran on, pick a randomised name for the stand up host and the ability to export out the scheduling. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the applications dependencies and is reliant on these to work, whilst Jest will be used to handle testing. Developed by Elliott Hutchins @eh220119a.

<h2>Reasoning for Application</h2>
Within the Agile development workspace, teams are usually reliant on repeated daily stand-ups to demonstrate what the team has been working on in the past 24 hours, what is hindering their progress or acting as a blocker, whilst also communicating what is planned to do moving forward.
