#Centralised Tracking for Stand-Ups
A basic application for those working with daily meetings to track and manage who is due to host a meeting. This application will allow the clients to pass their colleagues names, assign dates to which the stand-ups shall be ran on, pick a randomised name for the stand up host and the ability to export out the scheduling. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the applications dependencies and is reliant on these to work, whilst Jest will be used to handle testing. Developed by Elliott Hutchins @eh220119a.
