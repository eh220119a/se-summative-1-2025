<h1>Centralised Tracking for Stand-Ups<h1></h1>

A basic application for those working with daily meetings to track and manage who is due to host a meeting. This application will allow the clients to pass their colleagues names, assign dates to which the stand-ups shall be ran on, pick a randomised name for the stand up host and the ability to export out the scheduling.
